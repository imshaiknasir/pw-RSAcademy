# The Curious Case of Playwright Tests: Why npm run Sometimes Can't Find Your Tests

Have you ever faced a baffling situation where your Playwright tests run perfectly when you execute them directly from the terminal, but mysteriously fail with "No tests found" when you try to run them via an `npm` script defined in your `package.json`? If so, you're not alone! This is a classic "gotcha" related to how different shells and `npm` handle string parsing.

Let's dive into a real-world scenario and demystify this quirky behavior.

## The Scenario: My Playwright Tests Disappeared (Almost!)

Imagine you have a Playwright test file, say `ui/UIBasicstest.spec.js`, and within it, you've tagged some tests with `@smoke`:

```javascript
// ui/UIBasicstest.spec.js

import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('Browser Context Playwright Test @smoke', async ({ page }) => {
  // ... test code ...
});

test('Page Context Playwright Test @smoke', async ({ page }) => {
  // ... test code ...
});

// ... other tests ...
```

You then want to list these smoke tests. When you run the command directly in your terminal (e.g., using Git Bash/MINGW64 on Windows):

```bash
$ npx playwright test --grep '@smoke' --list
```

**Expected and Actual Output (Working!):**

```
Listing tests:
  ui\UIBasicstest.spec.js:8:1 › Browser Context Playwright Test
  ui\UIBasicstest.spec.js:15:1 › Page Context Playwright Test
Total: 2 tests in 1 file
```

**(Screenshot Placeholder: Output of direct `npx` command showing tests found)**

Everything looks good! Now, being a good developer, you decide to wrap this command in an `npm` script in your `package.json` for convenience:

```json
// package.json
{
  "name": "rsacademy_pw",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    // ... other scripts ...
    "test:smoke": "npx playwright test --grep '@smoke' --list"
  },
  // ... rest of package.json
}
```

And you run it:

```bash
$ npm run test:smoke
```

**Unexpected Output (Failing!):**

```
> rsacademy_pw@1.0.0 test:smoke
> npx playwright test --grep '@smoke' --list


Error: No tests found
Listing tests:
Total: 0 tests in 0 files
```

**(Screenshot Placeholder: Output of `npm run` command showing "No tests found")**

Frustrating, right? The command is *exactly* the same, the working directory is correct, yet one works and the other doesn't.

## The Culprit: Shell Interpretation and Quoting

The root cause lies in how your operating system's shell (like Git Bash/MINGW64) and `npm` interact when executing commands from `package.json` scripts. Specifically, it's about **string parsing and special characters**.

When you use single quotes (`'`) around `@smoke` in your `package.json` script, the shell might interpret the `@` symbol or the single quotes themselves in a way that prevents Playwright from receiving the exact `--grep '@smoke'` argument it expects. Some shells might treat characters within single quotes more literally, but when nested within an `npm` script, the `npm` process itself might perform an initial pass of interpretation before handing it off to the shell.

In essence, the special character `@` combined with single quotes can lead to the argument being malformed or misinterpreted by Playwright when it finally receives the command string.

## The Simple Fix: Embrace Double Quotes!

The solution is surprisingly simple: **use double quotes (`"`) instead of single quotes (`'`) for the `--grep` argument within your `package.json` script.**

Let's update the `package.json`:

```json
// package.json (Updated)
{
  "name": "rsacademy_pw",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    // ... other scripts ...
    "test:smoke": "npx playwright test --grep \"@smoke\" --list"
  },
  // ... rest of package.json
}
```

*Note: I've escaped the inner double quotes with a backslash `\"` because the outer script string in `package.json` is also wrapped in double quotes. This is common in JSON string values.*

Now, when you run the `npm` script again:

```bash
$ npm run test:smoke
```

**Expected and Actual Output (Success!):**

```
> rsacademy_pw@1.0.0 test:smoke
> npx playwright test --grep "@smoke" --list

Listing tests:
  ui\UIBasicstest.spec.js:8:1 › Browser Context Playwright Test
  ui\UIBasicstest.spec.js:15:1 › Page Context Playwright Test
Total: 2 tests in 1 file
```

**(Screenshot Placeholder: Output of corrected `npm run` command showing tests found)**

## Why Double Quotes Work Their Magic

Using double quotes ensures that the entire string `"@smoke"` is treated as a single, literal argument and passed exactly as intended to the `playwright` command. Double quotes generally allow for variable expansion and command substitution within a shell, but when used within `package.json` scripts and properly escaped, they effectively "protect" the inner string from premature or incorrect interpretation by `npm` and the intermediate shell process.

This robust quoting ensures that Playwright receives the `--grep` argument precisely as `grep "@smoke"`, allowing it to accurately identify and filter your smoke tests.

## Key Takeaway

When defining `npm` scripts, especially those involving special characters or arguments that need to be passed literally to a command, **always consider how your shell and `npm` might interpret the strings**. When in doubt, proper quoting (often double quotes with escaping) can save you hours of debugging a seemingly identical command that behaves differently.

Happy testing!
